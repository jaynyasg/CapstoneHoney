"""Documentation-consistency checks for the DP-HONEY README (U7).

These tests keep the README's compatibility matrix and safety boundaries locked
to the live registry. Example tokens in the README are intentionally NOT asserted
against secret-looking regexes -- they are illustrative, synthetic, and reviewed
by hand (the plan's safety-path note).
